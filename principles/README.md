# Principles

## Preamble

Included below are a list of principles. No, not 'universal principles' that apply in all cases, situations, and scenarios. These are 'personal principles', things that guide my approach to thinking, planning, execution, collaboration, and pretty much everything else that relates to work in general and my work in particular.

A few notes:

- These principles are fluid, meaning that they will change over time. New principles will emerge, and existing principles will be modified or discarded. This is natural, expected, and good.
- These principles are based on my personal and professional experiences. I don't expect them to work for everyone (they won't), but they've helped me and they _may_ help you too.
- These principles are comprehensive, but they are not exhaustive. I've made an effort to capture the things that I believe most deeply, and which I think are worth sharing with others.
